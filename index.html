      <h2>ABOUT FELIX</h2>
      <div class="about-content">
        <p>
          Felix Morelo, a Colombian-American artist, has become a prominent
          figure in the New York City art scene with his distinctive and
          engaging street art. Known for his whimsical chalk drawings, Morelo
          has transformed the mundane sidewalks of NYC into interactive canvases
          that invite public participation and provoke thought. His work, which
          includes Good Luck and Bad Luck Spots, has been featured in multiple
          media outlets, including
          <strong>The New York Times</strong>, where Amelia Nierenberg writes:
        </p>

        <p>
          “Felix Morelo’s chalk circles give parks, paths, and pavements a burst
          of spiritual energy.”
        </p>

        <h3>Early Life and Inspiration</h3>
        <p>
          Born in the United States, Morelo grew up with deep ties to his
          Colombian heritage. He moved to New York City at the age of eleven.
          His passion for art was evident from an early age, and he pursued
          formal education in the arts, studying painting at Parsons School of
          Design and drawing at The Art Students League of New York City.
          Initially, Morelo’s work consisted primarily of chalk-drawn faces
          scattered throughout the city. However, his artistic journey took a
          pivotal turn in 2010 when he began to create his now-famous “Good Luck
          Spots”.
        </p>

        <h3>The Good Luck and Bad Luck Spots</h3>
        <p>
          The concept of the "Good Luck Spots" emerged as an evolution of
          Morelo's earlier work. Encouraged by a fellow artist to provide a
          conclusive element to his trails of chalk faces, Morelo introduced
          these spots as whimsical, interactive installations. Each spot, marked
          by a chalk circle, features messages such as “Good Luck Spot,” “Bad
          Luck Spot,” “Hugging Spot,” “Screaming Spot,” “Laughing Spot,” and
          more. These installations are not just artistic expressions but social
          experiments aimed at challenging superstitions, taboos, and everyday
          routines.
        </p>
        <p>
          His controversial spots like “Racist,” “Suicide,” and “Israel and
          Palestine” have sparked street attacks, death threats, and intense
          debates among strangers, reflecting the power of his art to incite
          discussion and reflection. Morelo’s spots can be found in various
          parks and streets across Manhattan, including Union Square and
          Washington Square Park. The intention behind these spots is to engage
          passersby, inviting them to interact with the artwork and, by
          extension, with each other. This interactive element is a core aspect
          of Morelo's work, encouraging viewers to break out of their daily
          routines and engage in spontaneous social interactions.
        </p>

        <h3>Artistic Philosophy and Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Felix Morelo's work is deeply rooted in the exploration of human
          psychology and social behavior. His chalk circles, often brightly
          colored and whimsically designed, serve as more than just art; they
          are tools for social interaction and community building. By drawing
          people into these spots, Morelo challenges them to question their
          beliefs and engage with their surroundings in new ways. This approach
          is particularly resonant in the post-pandemic world, where social
          distancing and isolation have become common themes. Morelo’s spots
          offer a playful yet poignant reminder of the importance of human
          connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to his SPOT drawings, Morelo's portfolio further explores
          human multifaceted nature through his “CUBES” series. This series
          presents order and stability where organic and chaotic experiences,
          feelings, desires, dreams, nightmares, wishes, and fantasies are
          housed within boxes or cubes. In both series, memories can be played
          out, explored, and analyzed; one immediate, the other introspective.
        </p>

        <h3>Exhibitions and Public Recognition</h3>
        <p>
          While Morelo’s chalk drawings are his most recognizable work, he also
          creates murals and portable art pieces. His work has been featured at
          various venues such as Lehman College, New Jersey City University -
          Lehman College Gallery, The Blackburn 20/20 Gallery under Robert
          Blackburn Printmaking Workshop, Newfields – Indianapolis Museum of
          Art, The Raynham Hall Museum of Oyster Bay, NYC Galleries including
          Howl Happening and Time to Be Happy, and international shows at
          Fondazione Giorgio Cini in Venice, Italy, and Dianxi Science and
          Technology Normal University in Lingang, China. His work has garnered
          both local and international attention, emphasizing the cultural and
          social impact of his art. His innovative approach to public art has
          earned him a place among New York City's most beloved street artists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The New York City Artist Corps awarded him a grant, and five
          commissioned murals reach audiences daily in New York City. Mr. Morelo
          is currently self-represented, but has been formerly affiliated by
          galleries such as Artist Abbey Gallery in Truth and Consequences in
          New Mexico, and Mique Gallery in Tokyo Japan. At this time, he is
          affiliated with the with Time to Be Happy Gallery in New York City and
          TENTEN a non profit artist organization.
        </p>

        <h3>Entrepreneurial Ventures</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to his public installations, Morelo runs a mini portable
          storefront, where he sells painted cardobard versions of his spots, as
          well as button and stickers. This entrepreneurial aspect of his
          practice allows him to share his art with a broader audience, making
          his whimsical creations accessible to anyone who wishes to take a
          piece of his street art home. Morelo also dabbles in performance art,
          poetry, sculpting, printmaking, and bookmaking, showcasing his
          versatility as an artist and his deep engagement with the New York
          City art community.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Felix Morelo’s art transcends simple visual aesthetics; it is a
          dynamic and interactive experience that fosters community and
          challenges social norms. Through his chalk circles and other creative
          endeavors, Morelo has made a lasting impact on the cultural landscape
          of New York City. His work continues to inspire, provoke, and bring
          joy to the countless individuals who encounter it daily. As Morelo
          himself often reflects, his art is about breaking barriers, fostering
          connections, and inviting everyone to find a little magic in the
          everyday.
